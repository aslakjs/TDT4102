# TDT4102 - Assignment 3
<b>ObjectOrientedC++</b>
A <i>somewhat reasonable</i> way of solving assignment 3.

<br>

<b>¡Note!</b><br>Program comes with a test/debug mode, which is turned to "false" by default. By toggling the debug to "true", you will bypass <b>all</b> main code.

<i><b>¡Change with care!</b></i>

Default debug-function is predetermined to test calculations.<br><b>!etoN¡</b>
<br>

<b> Instructions:</b>
On startup you'll run into the main menu, from which you can choose between:
- Exit      (char 0) (exits the program)
- Info      (char i) (gets copyright info)
- Task 4d   (char 1) (target practise task)
    - Enter your target distance
    - Shoot and try to hit target
        - angle of fire and velocity entered manually in-game.
- Task 5    (char 2) (Shoot the target - Game)
    - You get to shoot 10 times, try to hit a "hidden" target.
        - angle of fire and velocity entered manually in-game.
    - Terminal output only. No graphical interface.

There is lots of comments within source code to supplement reading.
Some stuff should be self explainatory.

<b>Notes:</b>
- Task 2g: 
    - Not fully implemented overload operator<<.
	- It somehow only prints a pointer to the Class element, not the element.matrix value.
	- The print statements are therefore swapped with a call to a spesific print function instead.
- Task 5a and 5b: 
    - Not fully implemented overload operator+= and operator+
	- Will yield correct A matrix, however matrix B changes.
<br><br>

<b>Startup:</b>
- Compile and run program.
- Main menu opens on startup
	- Navigate menu by input character shown.
	- ie: Input char(1) for [1] - Task 1
- Task 1 contains sepperate menu
	- Input char(0) to return to main.
- Task 2-5 will automaticly loop back to main when complete.
